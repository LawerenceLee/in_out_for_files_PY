open(filename, mode="r")opens a file. More info in the docs.

https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#open

file.read(bytes=-1) would read the entire contents of the file. You can control the number of bytes read by passing in an integer. Relatedly, file.seek() will move the read/write pointer to another part of the file.

file.readlines() reads the entire file into a list, with each line as a list item.

The context manager pattern for dealing with files is:

with open("my_file.txt", "r") as file:
    file.read(10)

Note:  
    If file.read(byte_arg) is called multiple times, it reads from where it last left off. Such as, if you read in ten
    and then called the function again it would read from the eleventh byte.

    To reset or read from the beginning of a file use file.seek(0).
